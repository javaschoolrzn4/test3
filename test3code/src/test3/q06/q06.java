/*
The hashCode() method of a class can be used to test inequality but not equality of two objects of that class.
In other words, if the hash codes of two objects of the same class are not equal, you can definitely say that the objects
are not equal, However, if the hash codes are equal, you cannot say anything about the equality of the objects.
(Assume that the equals and hashCode contract is not violated by the class.)
        Select 1 option:
       !A. True
        B. False
