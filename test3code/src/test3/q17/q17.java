/*
What can you do to make a class immutable?
        NOTE: This statement is ambiguous. The immutability could refer to the immutability of two things - class or the
        objects of the class. Expect such ambiguity in the real exam questions as well. Our guess is that it refers to the objects
        of a class.
        Select 3 options:
        A. Make constructor private.
       !B. Make member fields private and final and include public getters for them.
       !C. Make the class final.
       !D. Instead of a default no-args constructor, create a constructor that initializes the members.
        E. Declare the members protected.
        F. Declare members static.
        G. Make the setters private.
